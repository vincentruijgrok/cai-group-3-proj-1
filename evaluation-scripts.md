### Alice

Always inform the bot about truthfully about the rooms checked victims found and picked up

_Until all unblocked rooms are checked and cleared:_

1. Go to the closest unchecked room
2. If unblocked, enter the room, otherwise go the next unchecked room and repeat this step
3. check all parts of the room for victims
4. If no victims are being carried already, and if critically injured victim is in room, call for help from rescuebot, and carry victim to safety,  
   else if mildly injured victim is in room, pick up victim
5. If carrying all remaining mildly injured victims, drop them off to safety
6. repeat

_When no more victims are in unblocked rooms:_

1. Go to the closest unchecked room
2. if the room is blocked with a bush, remove alone,
   if the room is blocked by a rock, remove with rescuebot
3. execute steps 2 - 5 from the list above
4. repeat

_When rescuebot calls for help:_

* bush removal: do not help
* rock removal: help if distance close
* rescueing mildly injured: do not help
* rescuing critically injured: help if not carrying mildly injured

### Charlie

Charlie is lazy, therefore she never helps the bot. 50% of the time she does not complete what she says, do a coin flip to decide whether to finish or not.

_Until all unblocked rooms are checked and cleared:_

1. Go to the closest unchecked room
2. If unblocked, enter the room, otherwise go the next unchecked room and repeat this step
3. check all parts of the room for victims 50% of the time, the other 50% check only the tile after the door
3. if critically injured victim is in room, call for help from rescuebot, and carry victim to safety (50% of the time call for help but leave before bot arrives),  
   else if mildly injured victim is in room, pick up victim and return carry them to rescue (50% of the time) or drop them off half way (50% of the time)
5. repeat

_When no more victims are in unblocked rooms:_

1. Go to the closest unchecked room
2. if the room is blocked with a bush, remove alone,
   if the room is blocked by a rock, remove with rescuebot
3. execute steps 2 - 4 from the list above
4. repeat

_When rescuebot calls for help:_

* bush removal: do not help
* rock removal: do not help
* rescueing mildly injured: do not help
* rescuing critically injured: do not help
